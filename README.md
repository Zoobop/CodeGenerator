# CodeGenerator
A small web application that allows for converting entire C# files (.cs) or real-time C# code into any of the available languages.
This project example was created for the purpose of testing and showcasing the LanguageConversion API with a visual interface.

**NOTE:** The visual design of this web application was to remain simple as to focus on the Front-End to Back-End connection.
